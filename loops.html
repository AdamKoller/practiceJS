      <!-- you can run the smae code multiple times using Loops
      WHILE loops run 'while' a condition is true and stops once it is false
        var ourArray = [];
        var i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
          ourArray.push(i);
          i ++;
        }
      -->
      <script>
        var myArray = [];
        var i = 0;
          while (i <  5) {
            myArray.push(i);
            i ++;

       <!-- FOR loops run 'for' a specific number of times
      declared with three optional expressions seperated by semicolons:
        for ([initialization];[condition];[final-expression])
      initialization is executed one time only beofre loop starts
      condition is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and continues as long as its true(if condition is false at the start, loop will never execute)
      final expression is ran at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter
              var ourArray = [];
              for (var i = 0; i < 5; i ++) {
                ourArray.push(i);
              }
      the above will start with i = 0 and iterate as long as i < 5 is true while incrementing by one after each iteration.
      ourArray starts off with an empty array([]) and ends with [0,1,2,3,4]-->
      <script>
        var myArray = [];
        for (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
          myArray.push(i);
        }
        document.write(myArray);
      </script>
